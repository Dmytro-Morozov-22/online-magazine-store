# Project description
The idea of this application is to create an online store where clients can buymagazines. 
I have implemented some rules in this application: An administrator fills in the catalogof magazines. 
Clients can make a prepayment by pre-selecting the magazine from the list. Thesystem calculates the amount to be paid and registers the payment. 
The client can unsubscribefrom the magazine. Unregistered clients can view magazines, but cannot subscribe to them.
